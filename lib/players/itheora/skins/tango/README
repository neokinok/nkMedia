1) INSTALLATION - USE

To install, simply unpack this archive in the "skins" directory of your ITheora installation.

To use the skin, add the argument "s=tango". To disable some buttons simply delete the relative icons from the "boutons" folder,
or use the "d=" argument (o: options, s: share, f: fullscreen, d: download). See http://itheora.org/?p=install for further reference.
